# H1 ALWAYS SUNNY SLOT MACHINE GAME:

This Always Sunny In Philadelphia themed slot machine game uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to display each main character each time you hit the spin button. 
Just like a casino slot machine game you would find in Vegas, you can try your luck at getting three in a row of your favorite, or most hated character!
